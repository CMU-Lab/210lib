The 210 library and documentation.

dist/ contains the main 210 library that is released to students.

test/ contains a test framework for the library so nothing breaks.

perf/ contains a performance testing framework, to verify that .fj
implementations are actually fast.

Remember to run "git submodule init" and "git submodule update"
to pull in the QCheck library before running the tests.
